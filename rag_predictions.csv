Principal Investment Strategies

The fund invests in California municipal and other debt securities with an emphasis on high-yield securities. A high-yield security is one that has been rated below investment-grade, or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers invest at least 80% of the fund’s net assets in municipal securities with income payments exempt from federal and California income taxes. Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories usually issue these securities for public projects, such as schools, roads, and water and sewer systems.

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax and California income tax (""California Municipal Bonds""). California Municipal Bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of the State of California and its political subdivisions, financing authorities and their agencies. The Fund may invest in debt securities of an issuer located outside of California whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from regular federal income tax and California income tax.

Risk of Residual Interest Bonds. The Fund may enter into residual interest bond transactions, which expose the Fund to leverage and greater risk than an investment in a fixed-rate municipal bond.

The value and market for residual interest bonds are volatile and such bonds may have limited liquidity.

Equity securities include common stocks and other securities that represent an ownership interest (or right to acquire an ownership interest) in a company or other issuer. Debt instruments include corporate bonds, foreign government securities, U.S. Government securities, asset-backed securities, and other obligations to repay money borrowed. MFS generally invests approximately 60% of the fund’s assets in equity securities and approximately 40% of the fund’s assets in debt instruments. These weightings do not reflect the fund’s cash balance and can vary over time due to market movements and cash flows.

Of the fund’s investments in equity securities, MFS focuses on investing the fund’s assets in the stocks of companies it believes are undervalued compared to their perceived worth (value companies).",False
