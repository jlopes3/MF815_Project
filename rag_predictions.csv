Ivy Small Cap Core Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in various types of equity securities of small-capitalization companies that IICO believes have the greatest potential for capital appreciation. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets will be invested, at the time of purchase, in common stocks of small-capitalization companies. For purposes of this Fund, small-capitalization companies typically are companies with market capitalizations within the range of companies in the Russell 2000 Index at the time of acquisition. As of June 30, 2018 (the quarter-end closest to the index’s rebalance), this range of market capitalizations was between approximately $51.89 million and $6.69 billion.",{'source': 'NLP_app/MutualFundSummary/Ivy Small Cap Core Fund.txt'},Equity Long Only (Low Risk),True

The following table illustrates the Portfolio's target allocations among asset classes (the target allocations and/or actual holdings will vary from time to time as a result of the tactical allocation process, although these variations will remain within the ranges described above):

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund will generally invest in larger-sized companies using a quantitative model that combines fundamental measures of a stock’s value and growth potential. To measure value, the managers may use ratios of stock price-to-earnings and stock price-to-cash flow, among others. To measure growth, the managers may use the rate of growth of a company’s earnings and cash flow and changes in its earnings estimates, as well as other factors. The model also considers price momentum. The portfolio managers also take environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") factors into account in making investment decisions.  The portfolio managers attempt to build a portfolio of stocks that provides better returns than, and a dividend yield comparable to, the S&P 500® Index, without taking on significant additional risk.

Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities.",{'source': 'NLP_app/MutualFundSummary/SUSTAINABLE EQUITY FUND.txt'},Equity Long Only (Low Risk),True
